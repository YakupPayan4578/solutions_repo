This angle is the angle the ball makes with the ground when thrown. Low Angles (0-30 degrees): If you throw the ball at a low angle close to the ground, it won\u2019t travel far before hitting the ground. So, the range will be short. Medium Angles (30-60 degrees): If you throw the ball at a steeper angle (around 45 degrees), it will travel farther. These angles generally give the best range. High Angles (60-90 degrees): If you throw the ball almost straight up, it will stay in the air longer, but won\u2019t travel very far. The range will be short again. The formula for the range \\( R \\) of a projectile is: \\[ R = \\frac{{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}}{g} \\] Where: ( \\(R\\) ) is the range (how far the object travels horizontally). ( \\(v_0\\) ) is the initial velocity (the speed at which the object is thrown). \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) is the angle of projection (the angle the object is thrown at relative to the ground). ( \\(g\\) ) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately \\(9.8 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\\) ). In this formula, you can see that the range depends on both the initial speed and the angle. The best range is achieved when the angle is around 45 degrees because \\(\\sin(90^\\circ)\\) = 1 , giving the maximum possible range. 1.2 Horizontal and Vertical Motion Horizontal Motion (x-direction) The horizontal motion occurs at a constant velocity because we are ignoring air resistance. We start with Newton\u2019s second law: \\[ F_x = ma_x \\] Since there is no force acting on the object in the horizontal direction, the acceleration is zero, \\(a_x = 0\\) . This means the horizontal velocity is constant. The equation for horizontal motion is: \\[ x(t) = v_{0x} t = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) t \\] Vertical Motion (y-direction) In the vertical direction, the object is affected by gravity, so it accelerates downward. Newton\u2019s second law: \\[ F_y = ma_y = -mg \\] Solving this equation gives the vertical velocity as a function of time. The initial vertical velocity is \\(v_{0y} = v_0 \\sin(\\theta)\\) , so: \\[ v_y(t) = v_{0y} - g t = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) - g t \\] To find the vertical position as a function of time, we integrate the velocity: \\[ y(t) = v_{0y} t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\] 1.3 Changes in Launch Angle and Initial Velocity Changes in Launch Angle : The launch angle \\(\\theta\\) determines how steep or flat the projectile is launched. Different launch angles affect the projectile's trajectory in the following ways: Low angles (e.g. 15\u00b0): The projectile follows a flatter path and reaches the ground quickly, covering less horizontal distance. Medium angles (e.g. 45\u00b0): The projectile achieves a good balance of horizontal distance and vertical height, reaching the maximum range . High angles (e.g. 75\u00b0): The projectile follows a steeper path, reaching a higher vertical height but covering less horizontal distance. Changes in Initial Velocity : The initial velocity \\(v_0\\) is the speed at which the projectile is launched. Increasing the initial velocity increases both the range and the height of the trajectory: Low velocities : The projectile travels a shorter distance and reaches a lower height. High velocities : The projectile covers a longer distance and reaches a greater height. Changes in the initial velocity also lead to different solutions. Even with the same launch angle, increasing the initial velocity results in larger trajectories and longer ranges. myColab This graph shows the trajectories plotted for different initial velocities (10 m/s, 20 m/s, 30 m/s) and angles (30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 60\u00b0). The following points stand out in the graph: As the initial velocity \\(v_0\\) increases, the trajectories cover longer distances and reach higher altitudes. The maximum range occurs around 45\u00b0 for a given initial velocity. For lower and higher angles, the range decreases, but the height varies. 2.1 Analysis of the Range Dependence of Horizontal Range on the Projection Angle The horizontal range \\(R\\) of a projectile depends on the launch angle and is given by the equation: \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\] Where: - \\(v_0\\) is the initial velocity. - \\(\\theta\\) is the launch angle. - \\(g\\) is the acceleration due to gravity ( \\(9.8 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\\) ). \ud83d\udccc Effect of Launch Angle: When \\(\\theta = 0^\\circ\\) or \\(90^\\circ\\) , the range is zero because: \\[\\sin(0) = 0, \\quad \\sin(180^\\circ) = 0\\] The maximum range occurs at \\(45^\\circ\\) because: \\[\\sin(90^\\circ) = 1\\] For angles lower or higher than \\(45^\\circ\\) , the range decreases. 2.2 Effect of Other Parameters \ud83d\udccc Effect of Initial Velocity: The range increases as the initial velocity \\(v_0\\) increases. If the launch angle is kept constant, a higher initial velocity results in a longer range . Mathematically: \\[R \\propto v_0^2\\] \ud83d\udccc Effect of Gravitational Acceleration: Since \\(g\\) is in the denominator, an increase in gravity decreases the range : \\[R \\propto \\frac{1}{g}\\] If gravity is lower, the projectile will travel further. Summary \\[\\text{Maximum Range at } \\theta = 45^\\circ\\] \\[R \\text{ increases with } v_0\\] \\[R \\text{ decreases with } g\\] 3. Practical Applications In real-world scenarios, projectile motion is influenced by additional factors such as uneven terrain and air resistance , which modify the ideal trajectory. 3.1 Uneven Terrain If the landing height differs from the launch height, the range equation must be modified. The general equation for projectile motion with different initial ( \\(y_0\\) ) and final heights ( \\(y_f\\) ) is: \\[ y_f = y_0 + v_0 \\sin(\\theta) t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\] Solving for \\(t\\) and substituting into the range equation allows for trajectory adjustments on slopes. 3.2 Air Resistance In real-world motion, air resistance applies a force opposite to the velocity, modifying both range and trajectory. The equation of motion considering drag force \\(F_d = -kv\\) leads to a more complex system: \\[ m \\frac{d v}{d t} = -mg - kv \\] where \\(k\\) is the drag coefficient. As a result: - The range is reduced ( \\(R < R_{ideal}\\) ). - The trajectory is no longer perfectly parabolic. 3.3 Gravity Variations On different planets, gravity \\(g\\) changes, affecting the range: \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\] For example, on the Moon ( \\(g \\approx 1.63 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\\) ), the range increases significantly compared to Earth. Conclusion In practical applications, projectile motion deviates from the idealized model due to environmental factors. By incorporating these effects, more accurate predictions can be made for fields such as ballistics, sports, and space exploration . 4.1 Projectile Motion: Effects of Gravity, Angle, and Initial Velocity This graph visualizes the effects of different initial velocities , angles , and gravity values on projectile motion . Each line in the graph represents a different combination of initial velocity , angle , and gravity . X-axis (Horizontal Distance): Represents how far the object travels horizontally. Y-axis (Vertical Distance): Represents how high the object rises or how far it falls. The graph shows how each of the following parameters affect projectile motion: Initial Velocity (v\u2080): Higher initial velocities cause the object to travel further and reach greater heights. Angle (\u03b8): As the angle increases, the object reaches a higher point, but the horizontal distance decreases. An optimal angle (around 45\u00b0) gives the longest range. Gravity (g): As gravity increases, the object falls faster, resulting in a shorter range. This graph helps illustrate the varying effects of these parameters on projectile motion and provides insight into how each factor influences the object's trajectory.","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#11-investigating-the-range-as-a-function-of-the-angle-of-projection","text":"When you throw an object (like a ball) into the air, how far it travels horizontally depends on the angle at which you throw it.

The red dotted line shows the damping effect , which represents the energy lost due to friction. The green line shows the gravitational force that naturally pulls the pendulum back due to gravity. Small-Angle Approximation For small oscillations, we make an approximation: Small-Angle Approximation : If the oscillations are small, we mathematically approximate \\(\\sin \\theta \\approx \\theta\\) . This simplifies the equation. The equation of motion for a simple pendulum is given by: \\[\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + \\frac{g}{L} \\sin \\theta = 0\\] Applying the small-angle approximation ( \\(\\sin \\theta \\approx \\theta\\) ): \\[\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + \\frac{g}{L} \\theta = 0\\] This results in a linear differential equation, which describes simple harmonic motion. This simplified equation is a second-order differential equation, and its solution consists of two parts: 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Natural Oscillation (Homogeneous Solution) This represents the motion of the pendulum without any external force, only due to its natural movement. This solution determines how quickly or slowly the pendulum stops: Overdamped : The motion stops slowly. Critically damped : The motion stops as quickly as possible. Underdamped : The motion continues oscillating slowly, with decreasing amplitude. 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Forced Oscillation (Particular Solution) This part shows how an external force (like a motor pushing the pendulum) affects the motion. This external force causes the pendulum to oscillate regularly and continuously. As a result : The pendulum both performs its natural motion (oscillation) and continues with the motion influenced by the external force. When the frequency of the external force matches the natural frequency of the pendulum, large oscillations occur (this is called resonance ). myColab The blue line represents the natural oscillation , which gradually decreases over time due to damping. The green line shows the forced oscillation , which is driven by an external force and continues regularly. Resonance Condition What is Resonance? When an external force is applied to a system at a frequency equal to or very close to its natural frequency (\u03c9\u2080) , resonance occurs. In this case, the system reaches maximum amplitude (\u0398\u2080) and undergoes large oscillations. Natural Frequency (\u03c9\u2080): For a simple pendulum, the natural frequency is given by: \\[ \\omega_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{L}} \\] Where: - g \u2192 Acceleration due to gravity - L \u2192 Length of the pendulum Importance of Resonance: Resonance is a crucial concept in engineering. If the resonance frequency of a structure is miscalculated, external forces can cause large oscillations, leading to structural failure or damage . Vibration Control : Bridges, buildings, or machines can suffer destructive consequences if they enter resonance. Avoiding Mechanical Resonance : Systems such as engines, airplanes, and ships are specially designed to minimize vibrations caused by resonance . Summary: Resonance causes a system to undergo large oscillations when an external force interacts with the system at a frequency close to its natural frequency. This leads to energy accumulation, resulting in an increase in the amplitude of the oscillations. myColab myColab 2. Analysis of Dynamics We investigate how damping ( \\(b\\) ), driving amplitude ( \\(A\\) ), and frequency ( \\(\\omega\\) ) influence the motion: Low damping : The system exhibits sustained oscillations. High damping : Motion quickly dies out. Resonance : Maximum amplitude is observed at a specific \\(\\omega\\) . Chaotic motion : At certain parameter ranges, the system transitions into chaotic behavior. myColab 3. Practical Applications Energy Harvesting : Used in piezoelectric generators.

This is what Kepler's Third Law tells us: T\u00b2 \u221d r\u00b3 , meaning that the square of a planet's orbital period is directly proportional to the cube of its average distance from the Sun. 1. Derive the Relationship Between T\u00b2 and r\u00b3 We need two important concepts: Gravitational Law and Centripetal Force . Gravitational Law : The force between two objects is calculated like this: $$ F = \\frac{G M m}{r^2} $$ Where: G : Gravitational constant M : Mass of the Sun m : Mass of the planet r : Orbital radius Centripetal Force : The force required to keep an object moving in a circular path is: $$ F = \\frac{m v^2}{r} $$ We equate these two forces because the same force keeps the planet in orbit. $$ \\frac{G M m}{r^2} = \\frac{m v^2}{r} $$ We cancel out m from both sides. $$ \\frac{G M}{r^2} = \\frac{v^2}{r} $$ Now, velocity (v) is the speed of the planet in orbit and is given by: $$ v = \\frac{2 \\pi r}{T} $$ Where T is the orbital period.

Why This is Important in Astronomy Imagine you want to know how heavy a planet is or how far it is from the Sun. By using Kepler's Third Law , astronomers can calculate this! If you know the orbital period (how long it takes the planet to orbit) and the orbital radius (how far the planet is), you can figure out things like the planet's mass and distance from the Sun. This law helps predict orbital periods because once we know the distance, we can calculate how long it takes for a planet to orbit. Real-World Examples : GPS satellites : They use this law to stay in the right orbit around Earth. Planetary orbits : It helps us understand how planets like Earth or Jupiter orbit the Sun. Exoplanets : When we find new planets outside our solar system, we use this law to estimate how long their year might be! myColab What Does This Graph Show? The graph demonstrates the relationship between orbital period squared (T\u00b2) and orbital radius cubed (r\u00b3) for celestial bodies, illustrating Kepler's Third Law in action. Why Are GPS Satellites \"Far\" in the Graph? Although GPS satellites are close to Earth in reality, in the graph, they appear \"far\" because the scale of the orbital radii for planets is much larger, making the satellites' orbits look small in comparison. 3.

On a water surface, this can be easily observed when ripples from different points meet, forming distinctive interference patterns. These patterns can show us how waves combine in different ways, either reinforcing each other or canceling out. Studying these patterns helps us understand wave behavior in a simple, visual way. It also allows us to explore important concepts, like the relationship between wave phase and the effects of multiple sources. This task offers a hands-on approach to learning about wave interactions and their real-world applications, making it an interesting and engaging way to dive into wave physics. Task A circular wave on the water surface, emanating from a point source located at \\((x_0, y_0)\\) , can be described by the Single Disturbance equation: \\[ \\eta(x, y, t) = \\frac{A}{\\sqrt{r}} \\cdot \\cos\\left(kr - \\omega t + \\phi\\right) \\] where: \\(\\eta(x, y, t)\\) is the displacement of the water surface at point \\((x, y)\\) and time \\(t\\) , \\(A\\) is the amplitude of the wave, \\(k = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}\\) is the wave number, related to the wavelength \\(\\lambda\\) , \\(\\omega = 2\\pi f\\) is the angular frequency, related to the frequency \\(f\\) , \\(r = \\sqrt{(x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2}\\) is the distance from the source to the point \\((x, y)\\) , \\(\\phi\\) is the initial phase. Problem Statement: Your task is to analyze the interference patterns formed on the water surface due to the superposition of waves emitted from point sources placed at the vertices of a chosen regular polygon. Steps to Follow: Select a Regular Polygon: Choose a regular polygon (e.g., equilateral triangle, square, regular pentagon). Position the Sources: Place point wave sources at the vertices of the selected polygon. Wave Equations: Write the equations describing the waves emitted from each source, considering their respective positions.

Measure the time for 10 full oscillations ( \\(T_{10}\\) ) and repeat this process 10 times. Record all 10 measurements. Calculate the mean time for 10 oscillations ( \\(\\overline{T}_{10}\\) ) and the standard deviation ( \\(\\sigma_T\\) ). Determine the uncertainty in the mean time as: $$ \\Delta T_{10} = \\frac{\\sigma_T}{\\sqrt{n}} $$ where \\(n = 10\\) .","title":"Procedure:"},{"location":"1%20Physics/7%20Measurements/Problem_1/#calculations","text":"1 Calculate the period: \\(T = \\frac{\\overline{T}_{10}}{10}\\) and \\(\\Delta T = \\frac{\\Delta T_{10}}{10}\\) 2 Determine \\(g\\) : \\(g = \\frac{4\\pi^2 L}{T^2}\\) 3 Propagate uncertainties: \\(\\Delta g = g \\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\Delta L}{L}\\right)^2 + \\left(2\\frac{\\Delta T}{T}\\right)^2}\\)","title":"Calculations:"},{"location":"1%20Physics/7%20Measurements/Problem_1/#analysis","text":"1 Compare your measured \\(g\\) with the standard value ( \\(9.81 \\, \\text{m/s}^2\\) ). 2 Discuss: The effect of measurement resolution on \\(\\Delta L\\) .
