# ðŸ“Š Exploring the Central Limit Theorem through Simulations

## ðŸŽ¯ Motivation

The **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** tells us that:

$$
\text{As } n \to \infty,\ \bar{X}_n \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2/n)
$$

So, even if the population is not normal, the **mean of large samples** will follow a **normal distribution**.

Simulations help us **observe this behavior in action**, making the abstract idea more intuitive.

## ðŸ”§ Task Overview

### 1. Simulating Sampling Distributions

- We choose diverse population distributions to test the CLT:
  - **Uniform** (flat shape)
  - **Exponential** (skewed)
  - **Binomial** (discrete)

- For each, we create large datasets to mimic full populations.

### 2. Sampling and Visualization

- For sample sizes: **5, 10, 30, 50**, we take many random samples.
- We compute the **mean of each sample**.
- We plot **histograms** to show how sample means behave.
- These plots reveal how they become more **bell-shaped**.

### 3. Parameter Exploration

- We experiment with different distributions and sample sizes.
- We observe how **higher variance** causes wider sampling spread.
- We track how fast the **normal shape** appears.

### 4. Practical Applications

- Used to **estimate population parameters**.
- Important in **quality control** (e.g., factory outputs).
- Useful in **finance** to model uncertain outcomes.

## ðŸ“ˆ Deliverables

- Python notebooks showing the full simulation process.
- Histogram plots that illustrate sample mean behavior.
- Reflections on:
  - How the CLT appears visually.
  - Whether results match the theory.

## ðŸ’¡ Tips

- Libraries like `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, and `Seaborn` are helpful.
- Start with simpler cases (e.g., **Uniform**) to build intuition.
- Focus on:

  $$
  \bar{X} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i, \quad \text{Var}(\bar{X}) = \frac{\sigma^2}{n}
  $$

## ðŸ§  Key Insight

As sample size grows:

- The original distributionâ€™s shape matters **less and less**
- Sample means become **normally distributed**
- This supports **using normal models** in real-world problems
