### Problem 2

<span style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;">**Estimating Pi using Monte Carlo Methods**</span>

#### Motivation:

Monte Carlo simulations are a powerful class of computational techniques that use randomness to solve problems or estimate values. One of the most elegant applications of Monte Carlo methods is estimating the value of $\pi$ through geometric probability. By randomly generating points and analyzing their positions relative to a geometric shape, we can approximate $\pi$ in an intuitive and visually engaging way.

This problem connects fundamental concepts of probability, geometry, and numerical computation. It also provides a gateway to understanding how randomness can be harnessed to solve complex problems in physics, finance, and computer science. The Monte Carlo approach to $\pi$ estimation highlights the versatility and simplicity of this method while offering practical insights into convergence rates and computational efficiency.

#### Task

##### Part 1: Estimating $\pi$ Using a Circle

1 **Theoretical Foundation:**

   - Explain how the ratio of points inside a circle to the total number of points in a square can be used to estimate $\pi$.
   - Derive the formula $\pi \approx 4 \cdot (\text{points inside the circle} / \text{total points})$ for a unit circle.

2 **Simulation:**

   - Generate random points in a 2D square bounding a unit circle.
   - Count the number of points falling inside the circle.
   - Estimate $\pi$ based on the ratio of points inside the circle to the total points.

3 **Visualization:**

   - Create a plot showing the randomly generated points, distinguishing those inside and outside the circle.

4 **Analysis:**

   - Investigate how the accuracy of the estimate improves as the number of points increases.
   - Discuss the convergence rate and computational considerations for this method.

##### Part 2: Estimating $\pi$ Using Buffon’s Needle

1 **Theoretical Foundation:**

   - Describe Buffon’s Needle problem, where $\pi$ can be estimated based on the probability of a needle crossing parallel lines on a plane.
   - Derive the formula $\pi \approx (2 \cdot \text{needle length} \cdot \text{number of throws}) / (\text{distance between lines} \cdot \text{number of crossings})$.

2 **Simulation:**

   - Simulate the random dropping of a needle on a plane with parallel lines.
   - Count the number of times the needle crosses a line.
   - Estimate $\pi$ based on the derived formula.

3 **Visualization:**

   - Create a graphical representation of the simulation, showing the needle positions relative to the lines.

4 **Analysis:**

   - Explore how the number of needle drops affects the estimate’s accuracy.
   - Compare the convergence rate of this method to the circle-based approach.

#### Hints and Resources

- Use Python libraries such as NumPy for random number generation and Matplotlib for visualizations.
- For the circle-based method, ensure the random points are uniformly distributed within the square.
- For Buffon’s Needle, pay attention to geometric constraints, such as the relationship between the needle length and the distance between lines.
- Start with a small number of iterations to validate the implementation, then increase the sample size to observe convergence.
