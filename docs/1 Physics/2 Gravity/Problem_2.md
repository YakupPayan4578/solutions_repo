### Problem 2

<span style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;">Escape Velocities and Cosmic Velocities</span>

#### Motivation:

The concept of escape velocity is crucial for understanding the conditions required to leave a celestial body's gravitational influence. Extending this concept, the first, second, and third cosmic velocities define the thresholds for orbiting, escaping, and leaving a star system. These principles underpin modern space exploration, from launching satellites to interplanetary missions.

#### Task:

1. Define the first, second, and third cosmic velocities, explaining their physical meaning.
2. Analyze the mathematical derivations and parameters affecting these velocities.
3. Calculate and visualize these velocities for different celestial bodies like Earth, Mars adn Jupyter.
4. Discuss their importance in space exploration, including launching satellites, missions to other planets, and potential interstellar travel.

#### Deliverables:

1. A Markdown document with Python script or notebook implementing the simulations.
2. A detailed explanation of the subjects.
3. Graphical representations of escape velocities and cosmic velocities for various celestial bodies.
