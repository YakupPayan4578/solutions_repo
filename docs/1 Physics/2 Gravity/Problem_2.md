# üöÄ Cosmic Velocities: 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Cosmic Speeds

## üî∏ 1st Cosmic Velocity

**Definition:**  
The minimum velocity required for an object to orbit the Earth in a circular path without falling back to the surface.

**Formula:**

$$
v_1 = \sqrt{\frac{G \cdot M}{r}}
$$

**Parameters:**

- $v_1$: First cosmic velocity (m/s)  
- $G$: Gravitational constant ‚âà $6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{Nm}^2/\text{kg}^2$
- $M$: Mass of Earth ‚âà $5.972 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg}$  
- $r$: Radius of the Earth ‚âà $6.371 \times 10^6 \, \text{m}$

> This is the speed at which the gravitational force and the required centripetal force for orbit are balanced. The object stays in orbit without falling.

## üî∏ 2nd Cosmic Velocity

**Definition:**  
The minimum velocity required for an object to escape Earth's gravitational field and move into space.

**Formula:**

$$
v_2 = \sqrt{\frac{2 G \cdot M}{r}}
$$

**Parameters:**

- $v_2$: Second cosmic velocity (m/s)  
- $G, M, r$: Same as above

> This is the escape velocity. If an object reaches this speed, it will leave Earth‚Äôs gravity permanently without needing further propulsion.

## üî∏ 3rd Cosmic Velocity

**Definition:**  
The minimum velocity required for an object to escape not only Earth‚Äôs gravity but also the Sun‚Äôs gravitational pull, allowing it to leave the Solar System.

**Formula:**

$$
v_3 = \sqrt{\frac{2 G \cdot M_s}{R}}
$$

**Parameters:**

- $v_3$: Third cosmic velocity (m/s)  
- $G$: Gravitational constant  
- $M_s$: Mass of the Sun ‚âà $1.989 \times 10^{30} \, \text{kg}$  
- $R$: Average distance from Earth to the Sun ‚âà $1.496 \times 10^{11} \, \text{m}$

> This is the speed needed to escape the Solar System and continue toward interstellar space, like the Voyager 1 mission.

## üîªFactors Affecting Cosmic Speeds

| **Cosmic Velocity**    | **Influencing Factor**     | **Effect**                                                                |
|------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1st Cosmic Velocity (v‚ÇÅ)** | **Distance from Surface (r)** | As the distance increases, the velocity decreases because gravitational force weakens. |
|                        | **Earth's Mass (M)**        | As Earth's mass increases, the velocity increases because gravitational force becomes stronger. |
|                        | **Gravitational Constant (G)** | The value of G is constant, but it affects the gravitational force.      |
| **2nd Cosmic Velocity (v‚ÇÇ)** | **Distance from Surface (r)** | As the distance increases, the velocity decreases because gravitational force weakens. |
|                        | **Earth's Mass (M)**        | As Earth's mass increases, the velocity increases because gravitational force becomes stronger. |
|                        | **Gravitational Constant (G)** | The value of G is constant, but it affects the escape velocity.          |
| **3rd Cosmic Velocity (v‚ÇÉ)** | **Distance (R - Earth-Sun)** | As the distance from the Sun increases, the velocity decreases because gravitational force weakens. |
|                        | **Sun's Mass (M‚Çõ)**         | As the Sun's mass increases, the velocity increases because the Sun's gravitational force becomes stronger. |
