### Problem 3


<span style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;">Trajectories of a Freely Released Payload Near Earth</span>

#### Motivation:

When an object is released from a moving rocket near Earth, its trajectory depends on initial conditions and gravitational forces. This scenario presents a rich problem, blending principles of orbital mechanics and numerical methods. Understanding the potential trajectories is vital for space missions, such as deploying payloads or returning objects to Earth.

#### Task:

1. Analyze the possible trajectories (e.g., parabolic, hyperbolic, elliptical) of a payload released near Earth.
2. Perform a numerical analysis to compute the path of the payload based on given initial conditions (position, velocity, and altitude).
3. Discuss how these trajectories relate to orbital insertion, reentry, or escape scenarios.
4. Develop a computational tool to simulate and visualize the motion of the payload under Earth's gravity, accounting for initial velocities and directions.

#### Hints and Resources:

- Use fundamental gravitational principles, such as Newton's Law of Gravitation and Kepler's Laws, to derive equations and analyze scenarios.
- Leverage numerical methods or software tools (e.g., Python) to simulate orbits and trajectories.
- Explore real-world applications, such as space mission planning, satellite deployment, and planetary exploration.

These tasks provide a foundation for understanding gravity's influence on motion and its role in celestial mechanics and space exploration.

#### Deliverables:

1. A Markdown document with Python script or notebook implementing the simulations.
2. A detailed explanation of the subjects.
3. Graphical representations of orbital trajectories, escape velocities, and payload trajectories near Earth.
