## Gravity

### Problem 1

<span style="font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold;">Orbital Period and Orbital Radius</span>

#### Motivation:

The relationship between the square of the orbital period and the cube of the orbital radius, known as Kepler's Third Law, is a cornerstone of celestial mechanics. This simple yet profound relationship allows for the determination of planetary motions and has implications for understanding gravitational interactions on both local and cosmic scales. By analyzing this relationship, one can connect fundamental principles of gravity with real-world phenomena such as satellite orbits and planetary systems.

#### Task:

1. Derive the relationship between the square of the orbital period and the cube of the orbital radius for circular orbits.
2. Discuss the implications of this relationship for astronomy, including its role in calculating planetary masses and distances.
3. Analyze real-world examples, such as the Moon's orbit around Earth or the orbits of planets in the Solar System.
4. Implement a computational model to simulate circular orbits and verify the relationship.

#### Deliverables:

1. A Markdown document with Python script or notebook implementing the simulations.
2. A detailed explanation of the subjects.
3. Graphical representations of circular orbits and the relationship between orbital period and radius.
4. A discussion on how this relationship extends to elliptical orbits and other celestial bodies.
